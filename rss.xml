Employees with access to training and development programs have the advantage over employees in other companies who are left to seek out training opportunities on their own. The investment in training that a company makes shows the employees they are valued. The training creates a supportive workplace. Employees may gain access to training they wouldn&apos;t have otherwise known about or sought out themselves. Employees who feel appreciated and challenged through training opportunities may feel more satisfaction toward their jobs.</blockquote>,<p>Book A Free Consultation Today <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/s8sLzQSj8DeLYycu1">Here</a></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Review: Construction Training Management - CITB Training Levy Granted </h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1bdf9dcf-b102-4bb9-9fec-2fdc05f0219c.png" title="Construction Training Management and CITB Grant Recovery" alt="&ldquo;At Wild About Roofs we take (Construction) Health &amp; Safety and staff development very seriously. The main obstacle we had is being a small company we have limited resources and money.
&nbsp;
By recruiting Linda at Raven Training Solutions it allowed us to keep focus on Health and Safety Training for all staff. Ensuring we received reputable and sufficient training while making sure we received back the CITB Levy that we were due. Instantly we saw the benefits and so did our employees and subcontractors. Investing in our people made them feel both valued and safe.
&nbsp;
We would strongly recommend any small company to take advantage of outsourcing to Raven Solutions, it&rsquo;s worth the money and more!&rdquo;
