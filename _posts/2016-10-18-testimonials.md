# Testimonials - Don't just take our word for it!

---

We love to spread the word ...
![“At Wild About Roofs we take Health & Safety and staff development very seriously. The main obstacle we had is being a small company we have limited resources and money...
 
By recruiting Linda at Raven Training Solutions it allowed us to keep focus on H&S Training for all staff. Ensuring we received reputable and sufficient training while making sure we received back the CITB Grant that we were due. Instantly we saw the benefits and so did our employees and subcontractors. Investing in our people made them feel both valued and safe.
 
We would strongly recommend any small company to take advantage of outsourcing to Raven Solutions, it’s worth the money and more!”](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1bdf9dcf-b102-4bb9-9fec-2fdc05f0219c.png)
